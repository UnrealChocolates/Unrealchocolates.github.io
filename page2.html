    Two minds think alike is a term used to emphasize a coincidence, or two people reaching the same conclusion in any manner at the same time. Thinking of a response similar to each other. In this website, you are given some of life's biggest questions which you answer will be submitted based on your own opinion against mine (The creator), if we get the same answer, our two minds think alike! Simple as that! 
    
The website will respond to your choices when you pick Yes or No on the questions. It will appear green if we have the same answer and appear red if we have different answers. In that case... We do not think alike. Its just some fun, don't take it seriously. Unlock yourself.
